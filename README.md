# 206.-Reverse-Linked-List
Reverse Linked List â€“ LeetCode Problem 206   
 
This project contains a C++ implementation of LeetCode Problem 206: Reverse Linked List. Given the head of a singly linked list, the goal is to reverse the list and return the new head.

The solution includes:

âœ… An iterative approach (O(n) time, O(1) space) â€” most efficient and interview-friendly

ðŸ§ª Optional test cases using main() to demonstrate reversing a list

ðŸ›  Clean, readable, and well-commented C++ code

ðŸ§  Problem Summary
Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Constraints: List size [0, 5000], node values between -5000 and 5000
